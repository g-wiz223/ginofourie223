# 👋 Hi, I’m Gino Fourie

Backend Automation Engineer | Internal Tools & Systems  
Python • APIs • Data Pipelines • Operations Automation

I build **backend systems and internal tools** that automate business operations, clean up data, and replace fragile spreadsheets with reliable, auditable workflows.

My focus is on **practical backend engineering** — systems that run quietly in the background and keep operations, inventory, and finance in sync.

## What I Work On

### Backend & Automation
- Python automation and backend scripting
- API integrations, webhooks, and data syncs
- File watchers, parsers, and background jobs
- CSV / JSON pipelines and data normalization
- Lightweight backend systems for small and medium businesses

### Operations & Finance Systems
- Inventory tracking & automated stock updates
- Usage-based costing and margin calculations
- Job tracking and operational KPIs
- Asset registers and depreciation logic
- Process automation for finance & ops workflows

### Applied Engineering Context
- Manufacturing and production data systems
- G-code parsing → usage → costing pipelines
- Systems designed for real-world constraints, not demos

---

## Current Focus
- G-code parsing for material usage & runtime tracking
- Automated inventory and costing updates via APIs
- Backend tooling for operations and finance teams

---

## Tools & Tech
- **Python**
- **Git & GitHub**
- **REST APIs**
- **JSON / CSV**
- **VSCodium / VS Code**
- **Notion-style operational databases**

---

## How I Add Value
- Turn messy operational data into structured systems
- Build backend tools that non-technical teams rely on
- Design systems with traceability, cost control, and scalability in mind
- Think in workflows, not just endpoints
