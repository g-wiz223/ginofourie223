# 👋 Hi, I’m Gino Fourie

Backend Automation & Operations Systems Engineer  
Mechanical Design Engineer | Automation & Systems Builder | Additive Manufacturing

I build **practical internal tools and systems** that turn messy engineering, manufacturing, and finance operations into **clean, reliable, auditable workflows**.

My background sits at the intersection of:
- Engineering & manufacturing
- Backend automation
- Operations, costing, and finance systems

I focus on solving real operational problems — not demo apps.

##What I Work On

###Automation & Backend Systems
- Python automation and scripting
- Backend integrations (APIs, webhooks, data syncs)
- File watchers, parsers, and background jobs
- Lightweight backend systems for SMEs

###Engineering & Manufacturing Systems
- Mechanical design & prototyping
- Additive manufacturing (FDM, high-temp, industrial)
- Manufacturing data pipelines  
  *(G-code → usage → inventory → costing)*
- Scan → Design → Print → Build workflows

###Operations & Finance Systems
- Inventory tracking & material usage systems
- Job costing and margin tracking
- Asset registers & depreciation logic
- KPI dashboards (weekly / monthly ops & finance views)
- Process documentation and system rollouts

---

##Current Focus
- G-code parsing → filament usage & runtime tracking
- Automated inventory updates via APIs
- Cost-per-part and cost-per-job calculations
- Backend tooling for engineering & manufacturing operations

---

##Tools & Tech
- **Python**
- **Git & GitHub**
- **REST APIs**
- **JSON / CSV**
- **VSCodium / VS Code**
- **Notion-style operational databases**
- **SolidWorks / CAD**
- **3D Printing** (Prusa, Bambu, Creality, HT90)

---

##How I Add Value
- Bridge the gap between engineers, ops, and finance
- Replace spreadsheets with reliable systems
- Design tools that people actually use
- Think in workflows, not just features
